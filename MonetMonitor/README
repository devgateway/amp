**Application purpose**

Monitor the status of the monetdb server (check if it's up) and restart if it's down. 
**Checking monetdb server status**

Checking whether the monetdb server is up is done by connecting via the JDBC driver 
and running the "select tables.name from tables" query. 

**Settings.conf**
The settings.conf file has to be placed in the work directory (outside the .jar, 
if you've packaged the app). 


Settings.conf parameters 
MONET_EXEC_PATH - path to the monet executable (a .bat for Windows, monetdbd for linux)
MONET_FARM_PATH - blank in Windows, the path to the monet farm in Linux 
TIMER_DELAY  - delay between attempts to connect to the monetdb server to check its status (seconds)
LOG_FILE_PATH - path to the logfile 
DB_NAME - database name
NO_GUI - "true" for no GUI  status window to appear


**Installation as service**
	Under a Windows system:
	0. Correctly configure settings.conf
	1. Open the task manager
	2. Notice the instances of 'java'
	3. Run the monetmonitor_final.jar (java -jar monetmonitor_final.jar)
		3.1 Should output "Starting beholder with timer delay=" "server running" or 
		3.2 throw an exception twice (about server not responding) and then start the server
			(after which output "server running")
		3.3 if it doesn't, check configuration in settings.conf		
	4. Notice the freshly appeared instance of 'java'
	5. Write down its PID (do not stop the application!) -- later referenced as <THE_PID>
	6. Extract the archive yajsw-stable-11.11.zip somewhere
	7. Open a command prompt as admin and go to the directory with the checked out project
		7.1 to open a command prompt as admin, either start->type in 'cmd'->ctrl+shift+enter->continue, or
		7.2 start->all programs->accessories->right-click on 'command prompt'-> run as administrator
	8. Input the following commands
	 	cd yajsw-stable-11.11
	 	bat\getConfig.bat <THE_PID>
	 	//you may close the jar now
	 	bat\runConsole.bat 
	 After the runConsole.bat, you should see output similar to what's happening after running the .jar.
	9. Open conf/wrapper.conf
	10. Find the line "wrapper.ntservice.name" and name the service in an appropriate manner (monetmonitor, for instance)
	11. Do the same for "wrapper.ntservice.description" (sample text:
		11.1 "A YAJSW-wrapped Java application for monitoring the status of the monetdb server and restarting it if it's down")
	12. Save and close wrapper.conf
	13. Input in the admin console "bat\installService.bat"
	14. Input in the admin console "bat\startService.bat"
	15. You're done. You may now verify that AMP is able to connect properly to the Monet server.
	16. Make sure Tomcat starts after Monet Monitor
	Dependency on one other service:
		sc config ServiceA depend= ServiceB
	Above means that ServiceA will not start until ServiceB has started. If you stop ServiceB, ServiceA will stop automatically.
	To remove all dependencies:
		sc config ServiceA depend= /
	To list current dependencies:
		sc qc ServiceA
	
Under a Linux system:
	
	0. Correctly configure settings.conf
	1. Open a console; cd to the folder where this project is checked out
	2. Run "pidof java"; write down the existing PIDs.
	3. In a separate console, run "java -jar monetmonitor_final.jar" (same working dir as before)
	4. Run "pidof java" in the first console again; notice the freshly appeared PID. 
	5. Write down its PID (do not stop the application!) -- later referenced as <THE_PID>
	6. Extract the archive yajsw-stable-11.11.zip somewhere (same directory is perfectly fine: "unzip yajsw-stable-11.11.zip")
	7. Input the following commands
	 	cd yajsw-stable-11.11
	 	bin\getConfig.sh <THE_PID> 
	 	//you may close the jar from the second console now
	 	bin\runConsole.sh
	 After the runConsole.sh, you should see output similar to what's happening after running the .jar.
	9. Open conf/wrapper.conf
	10. Find the line "wrapper.ntservice.name" and name the service in an appropriate manner (monetmonitor, for instance)
	11. Do the same for "wrapper.ntservice.description" (sample text:
		11.1 "A YAJSW-wrapped Java application for monitoring the status of the monetdb server and restarting it if it's down")
	12. Save and close wrapper.conf
	13. Input in the console  "bin\installService.sh" (it might ask you for the sudo password)
	14. Input in the admin console "bin\startService.sh"
	15. You're done. You may now verify that AMP is able to connect properly to the Monet server.
	
	 
--Known issues:
1) If throws error about conflicting JNA, you might have to remove JNA until the service is installed
2) On Windows, make sure java is added to $PATH
