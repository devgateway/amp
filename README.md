# Aid Management Program

## Supporting aid transparency and development effectiveness.

The Aid Management Program (AMP) is DG's flagship offering. [Implemented in almost 30 countries](https://www.developmentgateway.org/blog/short-history-amp-technology "A short history of AMP Technolobgy"), AMP is both far-reaching and locally effective. Streamlined systems allow independent country ownership and sustainability.

AMP helps governments and development partners gather, access, and monitor information on development activities, with the goal of increasing aid effectiveness. It includes a robust software application – the Aid Management Platform (AMP) – as well as training and policy support for sustainable program management.
