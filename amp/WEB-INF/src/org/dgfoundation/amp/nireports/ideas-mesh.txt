== A. runtime data structures ==
0. Cell<Amount> or Cell<Text> - contains 0+ values
1. Amount - immutable
2. Column: contains either cells or subcolumns
3. any column (measure) should be splittable by Funding Flow - at the last temporal level
4. 3 types of hierarchies:
	4a: percentages
	4b: flows (make it somehow generic through attributes?)
	4c: per-transaction attribute equaling the column
	4d: (does it make sense?): hierarchy by something which has no percentage, no attribute, no per-transaction value
		
== C. running ==
 Column.splitByYear/Month/
 totals
generate hierarchies:
	column.filter(metadata = X, percentage = Y)
		-> if cell has metadata, but different amount -> f.o.
		->

measures which are not affected by filters should be made columns
	-> what about those which have meaning for both year and overall (e.g. Execution Rate / Forecast Execution Rate)
	
	
	
ADD TESTS FOR:
	MonetaryAmount

	
REDO *info* columns as being part of the hierarchy
REDO *funding* columns as being part of the donor hierarchy
REDO v_organization_projectid
pledges sectors + programs should be somehow fixed (data model is broken)
add startup check for NULL ids in NiReports
pledges titles: make a new view for NiReports
v_component_funding_description, v_component_funding_organization_name - add as being part of 2 hierarchies
remove ORDER BY from views
v_activity_pledges_title:
	views which link pledges to activities are... different. These have to be changed, but in an another way - for later
	
make a per-column "slow check" function; implement it for PercentageColumns; make an endpoint for it
implement RunNode -> jsonb
