	4b: flows (make it somehow generic through attributes?)
	4c: per-transaction attribute equaling the column
		
== C. running ==
	
measures which are not affected by filters should be made columns
	-> what about those which have meaning for both year and overall (e.g. Execution Rate / Forecast Execution Rate)
	
REDO *info* columns as being part of the hierarchy
REDO *funding* columns as being part of the donor hierarchy
REDO v_organization_projectid
pledges sectors + programs should be somehow fixed (data model is broken)
pledges titles: make a new view for NiReports
v_component_funding_description, v_component_funding_organization_name - add as being part of 2 hierarchies
remove ORDER BY from views
v_activity_pledges_title:
	views which link pledges to activities are... different. These have to be changed, but in an another way - for later
	
in case fetching a column/measure crashes -> remove said column/measure from report and add a note about it to warnings
	-> treat the case when fetching a column which is also a hierarchy fails
	
filters: activities-id caching
year range settings
RELATED_PROJECTS: take care of the (id / related id) stuff
generate the following in-memory schemas:
	-> benchmarks schema
	-> testcases schema  -> Alex
	-> report wizard schema (as a tiny layer on top of testcases schema)

https://jira.dgfoundation.org/browse/AMP-22006 - DO NOT MERGE THIS ONE TO AMP 2.12

http://localhost:8080/rest/data/nireport/10 - report behaviour when no funding
by-year-hierarchies: generate list of all measures at the bottom
gross filtering-out of entries while fetching funding

testcases for the whole coos stack: tracker, fetching, filtering, applying percentages
remove activities without funding under a hierarchy
do not ignore null-percentage rows
test ReportCollapsingStrategy != UNKNOWNS
testcases ReportDataCollapser!!
change all references to Behaviour with ones to Behaviour<?>
caching layer on top of workspace filter
