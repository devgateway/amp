/**
 * @author Mihai Postelnicu ;
    This abstract class can be used to create ActionS that use multiple forwards to process
 * (especially) forms. The developer has to implement the subcontroller (the modeSelect method) that will
 * make the forward decision. This is how the process works : <br>
 *  - the modePrepare() method is invoked. Because this method will be executed whatever the mode, it's a
 * good place to put object initialisations that are shared by all modes. Also, global verifiers can be
 * posted here. <br>
 *  - before ending the modePrepare method, the servlet can call the modeSelect() method which will choose
 * the appropriate mode to be processed and will invoke the method associated with that mode <br>
 *  - the method will execute and, after processing, will return the forward, that will be returned to the
 * main Struts controller<p>
 * @see EditEUActivity
