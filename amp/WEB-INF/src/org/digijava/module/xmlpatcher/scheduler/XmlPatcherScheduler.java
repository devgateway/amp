/**
 * @author Mihai Postelnicu - mpostelnicu@dgfoundation.org Provides support for
 *         scheduling of patch execution order. The default behavior is to sort
 *         patches in natural order. However it may be desirable that a
 *         different execution schedule is to be followed.
 *         <p>
 *         The execution schedule does not refer to intrinsic conditions (like
 *         patch dependencies or any other logical conditions that are part of
 *         the XML file).
 *         <p>
 *         Examples of schedulers are:
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>by discovery date
 *         <li>by location priority - some locations/modules may get higher
 *         priority than others. For example you may wish to build a scheduler
 *         where the Category Manager module has higher priority for applying
 *         new patches than other modules
 *         <li>by patch attempts - you may want to try new patches first, that
 *         were not tried previously
 *         <li>by patch status - we can find useful running re-applicable failed
 *         patches before or after open patches
 *         </ul>
 *         The schedule will be available by iterating the collection obtained
 *         by {@link #getScheduledPatchCollection()}.
