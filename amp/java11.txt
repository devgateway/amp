Spring must be upgraded at least 5.1.x
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-Versions
Spring 3 because asm cannot read compiled classes.

Hibernate uses bytecode manipulation as well. Must be upgraded to either of these versions:
5.3.22+
5.4.32+
5.5
5.6
6.0

Jersey v1 - likely to work with java 11, last 1.x release is from 2015. Should upgrade.
Jersey v2 must be used! Java 11 is supported since 2.29.

Wicket IOC uses cglib!

-------------

cglib deps:
* wicket-ioc-6.29.0.jar
* mockrunner-0.4.1.jar
* spring-beans-3.0.7.RELEASE.jar

spring-asm-3.0.7.RELEASE.jar deps:
* spring-core-3.0.7.RELEASE.jar

----

asm 7.0 supports java 11
cglib 3.2.9 is using asm 7.0, and supports java 11?


Removed ThymeLeaf, mockrunner, jersey-spring, fop as we don't use it.
jersey-spring replaced with jersey-servlet

Why we need groovy?
