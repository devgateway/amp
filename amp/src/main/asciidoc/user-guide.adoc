= AMP REST API User Guide

== About

This is the reference for the AMP REST API. This API is the primary way to interact with AMP remotely, whether you
are building an app, scripting interactions with AMP or developing any other integration. This page documents the
REST resources available in AMP, along with expected HTTP response codes and sample requests.

== Authentication

REST API supports two kinds of authentications: cookie-based and token-based.

AMP itself uses cookie-based authentication in the browser, so you can call the REST API from
link:index.html[Swagger UI^] and rely on the authentication that the browser has established.

Cookie-based authentication is currently the preferred way to communicate with REST API.

[NOTE]
Token-based authentication was deprecated. If you are developing new client that connects to REST API please
consider using cookie-based authentication.

== Error handling

Most resources will return a response body in addition to the status code. Usually, the JSON object returned
has the following structure:

[source,json]
----
{
  "error": {
    "0000": [
      "(Title is required)"
    ]
  }
}
----
