/**
 * Class that holds the information of the the level of completion of projects
 * updates for a given donor on a given quarter. Donors need to update their
 * projects every quarter. How good they do that task is defined by a color.
 *  - Green cell: If a donor has updated more projects that the number defined by doing:
 *  Number of Updated Projects by donor > = Threshold  X total live projects of a donor on a given quarter, then 
 *  the  cell for that quarter will be green. 
 * - Gray cell: It the admin has been identified as a donor with no project updates (as
 * specified here), the donor will have a grey cell filled in for that quarter
 * - Red cell: If a donor has not updated projects or has updated projects but didnâ€™t reach the threshold and 
 * has not been identified as a donor with no project updates, the cell in the timeframe is filled in with
 * red. 
 * - Yellow cell: if a donor updates projects during the grace period, the update occurred is counted double. 
 *  It is counted on the quarter to which the grace period belongs; and it is also counted on the current quarter. 
 *  If the updates  performed on the grace period make the number of updates to reach or surpass the threshold for that quarter,
 *   then the previous quarter is marked with yellow.
