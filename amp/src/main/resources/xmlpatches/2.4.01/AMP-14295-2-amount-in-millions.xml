        migrate "Amount in Thousands" Global Setting from boolean to Integer (dropdown box)
        We need AMP-14295-1-create-sequence.xml in a separate file because one file is executed in a separate SQL Batch
        We cannot create a function an call it in one physical patch file to avoid: Problem with executeBatch and "A result was returned when none was expected"

   This patch will never succeed because it contains a "SELECT". Also, we don't have AMP <2.4 databases anymore, they have all been fixed manually.
   commenting out the whole mess
                update amp_field set amp_field_id=amp_field_id WHERE setval('util_global_settings_possible__seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM util_global_settings_possible_)) is not null;

				DELETE FROM util_global_settings_possible_ WHERE setting_name = 'Amounts in Thousands';

				INSERT INTO util_global_settings_possible_ (setting_name, value_id, value_shown) VALUES
				('Amounts in Thousands', '0', 'Amounts in Units'),
				('Amounts in Thousands', '1', 'Amounts in Thousands'),
				('Amounts in Thousands', '2', 'Amounts in Millions');

				UPDATE amp_global_settings
				SET
					description='Specifies whether, by default, money amounts will be specified in units, thousands or millions',
					possiblevalues = 'v_g_settings_amount_units',
					value_translatable = TRUE
				WHERE settingsname = 'Amounts in Thousands';

				UPDATE amp_global_settings
					SET settingsvalue = '0'
				WHERE settingsname = 'Amounts in Thousands' AND settingsvalue='false';

				UPDATE amp_global_settings
					SET settingsvalue = '1'
