this is AMP-Bootstrap's copy of https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/
This is also used in ActivityForm (I found out after having researched this independently), but the AF version is quite old. 
I did not risk updating the AF version; at the same time I did not want to reuse old JS libraries.
So, we end up (hopefully only temporarily) with 2 copies: one new for AMP-Bootstrap and one old for AF.
