/**
 * Support inheritable resources like: images, css, javascript. giving
 * appropriate URL to them, according to whether they were found in site's
 * folder, template's folder or blank folder.
 *
 * This means that an image may be in site tempalte folder and site does not
 * necessarily need to copy it into its own folder, it can be used from the
 * template (and from blank template by any site, therefore.).
 *
 * The search is performed in the following order: Site folder, Template folder
 * Blank Template folder. To boost the performance the result of this lookup is
 * cached. On the development server, you can turn off the cacheing from digi.xml, though.
 *
 * The tag may also have cache="false" attribute setting which will turn off
 * cacheing, in case if the resource is frequently-changing its place and cacheing
 * it does not make any sense.
