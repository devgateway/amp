        <p>ODAnic is the online database of Official Development Assistance (ODA) from development partners to Nicaragua. It was created in response to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which advocates stronger coordination of donor activities and better alignment of aid with the poverty reduction strategy of the Government of Nicaragua. Originally a tool for EU donors, in the spirit of increasing aid harmonization, ODAnic now contains information on assistance from the entire donor community in Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>ODAnic is user-friendly, free of charge, and available to all. Users can search for projects by donor, sector, and other criteria, and create custom reports using the "Design Your Own Report" function. ODAnic also contains donor profiles with each EU Member State's strategy for assistance to Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>With ODAmap, users can locate projects by geographic location. The EU Blue Book is an interactive, online resource with graphs and other tools to help users understand and analyze the data.</p><br />
        <p>Welcome to ODAnic!</p>

        <p><strong>About ODAnic</strong></p>
        <p>In 2007, the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) initiated and supported the establishment of ODAnic, an online interactive tool to centralize, coordinate and harmonize information on the activities of the European Commission and all EU Member States operating in Nicaragua.  Through ODAnic, EU donors launched the first ever electronic EU Blue Book for Nicaragua.  Both products were based on good practices in Mozambique (ODAmoz) and the EU Blue Book in Vietnam. </p>
        <p>In 2008, in a further step towards greater harmonisation, ODAnic was opened up to all donors operating in Nicaragua.  Today, a total of 21 donors have pledged to provide information to ODAnic.  Exploration is underway to link ODAnic to the Government of Nicaragua’s own aid information management system known as SysODA.</p>
        <p>The 2008 EU Blue Book is scheduled for release in April 2009.</p>
        <p>This new and improved version of ODAnic is a product of the Development Gateway, an international nonprofit organization with a mission to create and implement Web-based tools to make aid and development efforts more effective.  OECD, UNDP and the World Bank comprise the Development Gateway’s Aid Effectiveness Steering Committee and play a key role in guiding the direction of the aid effectiveness program. </p>
        <p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
        <p>The main purpose of ODAnic is to provide donors in Nicaragua with the tools and training to fulfill their reporting obligations under the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda for Action, following international standards and in the spirit of transparency and accountability.  At the same time, ODAnic also provides the Government, donors, civil society and the public a snapshot of donors’ strategies, projects and financial commitments.</p>
        <p>Since the Rome Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in 2003, Aid Information Management Systems have been widely recognized as essential tools for improving government and donor accountability, streamlining aid management practices, advancing donor coordination and ensuring more effective alignment of donor activities with country strategies.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Benefits</strong></p>
        <p>This approach to system implementations recognizes that technology solutions alone are not sufficient to bring about lasting change.  They should be adopted as part of a larger effort that brings partners together, puts sustainable management processes in place, and ensures long-term technical maintenance. </p>

          </p>
        <p><strong>Responsibility</strong></p>
        <p>Donors are responsible for maintaining and validating the information in ODAnic.  Each donor agency in a country selects a focal point to adhere to locally agreed guidelines and timelines for updates, while following international data classifications developed by the OECD Development Assistance Committee.  This information is then freely available to all.<br />
