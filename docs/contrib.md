# How to contribute to the Aid Management Platform

For general bugs and requests, you can use [our issues page](https://github.com/devgateway/amp/issues) on the Github project page.


If you want to contribute code directly, you can use the general Github recommendation for contributing to open source projects, found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

We summarize below the main steps:

## Fork the repo

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

See a complete description of what a fork is and how to make one on Github, [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

You may fork the Aid Management Platform by following [this link](https://github.com/devgateway/amp/fork).

## Clone the fork

After creating the fork, you must copy it locally in order to work. This is called cloning. 

Follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#cloning-a-fork) to produce a clone on your computer.

## Local development setup

Follow the instructions in the [Local Development Setup](/test-gh-pages/dev-setup/) page to setup your local development environment.

## Making and pushing changes

On the local cloned repository, you can change the code and make the required changes in similar way as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes).

## Making a pull request

A pull request is the final step in adding back your contribution to our code. Again, the Github contributing guide
[describes how you can achieve that](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request).
