          <p>ODAmoz is a new EC funded electronic tool that provides information on Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Mozambique. It was created in response to the Paris Declaration advocating for strengthened coordination and harmonization among Donors and alignment with the Government of Mozambique. </p>
          <p>ODAmoz enables to track Donors&#39; and United Nations Agencies&#39; projects and programmes in the country: where they are operating, who finances them, and which organization implements them. </p>
          <p>It is a user-friendly database, accessible to all through the internet. Its &quot;Design your own report&quot; function makes it easy to search for specific information through a set of predefined criteria (donor, sector, location, project status, funding type and MDGs) and offers tables and geographic maps (ODAmap) for analysis. </p>
          <p>Welcome to ODAmoz!</p>
