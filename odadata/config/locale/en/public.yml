        <p>ODAnic is the online database of Official Development Assistance (ODA) from EU Member States to Nicaragua. It was created in response to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which advocates stronger coordination of donor activities and better alignment of aid with the poverty reduction strategy of the Government of Nicaragua. In the spirit of increasing aid harmonization, ODAnic will soon contain information on assistance from a wider range of donor organizations.</p>
        <p>ODAnic is user-friendly, free of charge, and available to all. Users can search for projects by donor, sector, and other criteria, and create custom reports using the "Design Your Own Report" function. ODAnic also contains donor profiles with each EU Member State's strategy for assistance to Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>With ODAmap, users can locate projects by geographic location. The EU Blue Book is an interactive, online resource with graphs and other tools to help users understand and analyze the data.</p><br />
        <p>Welcome to ODAnic!</p>

        <p><strong>History</strong></p>
        <p>In 2007, the DFID representation in Nicaragua hired ODAdata Aid Information Management Systems to create a dynamic version of the EU Blue Book based on Best Practices in Mozambique (ODAmoz) and the EU Blue Book in Vietnam. ODAnic was established in order to centralise, and make available in a harmonised and coordinated way, information on the activities of the European Commission and all EU Member States operating in Nicaragua.</p> 
        <p>In a further step towards greater harmonisation, it was agreed to open up ODAnic in future to <strong>ALL</strong> Donors present in Nicaragua and link where possible to the Government of Nicaragua’s own Aid Information System (SYSODA).</p>
        <p>This initiative was fully endorsed by all EU Member States present in Nicaragua in order to simplify and harmonise the provision of information on EU Aid Flows to the country.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
        <p>The main objective and focus of ODAnic is to provide EU donors with a tool, based on international standards (e.g. OECD/DAC sector codification), to fulfill their reporting obligations It also gives the Government, donors, civil society and the public a snapshot of EU Donors strategies, projects and financial commitments.</p>
        
        <p><b>Update timeline</b></p>
        <p>The information in ODAnic is based on reports of quarterly disbursements, on forecasts for the current year and on annual values for the next <strong>3 years according to the Medium Term Expenditure Forecast (MTEF) procedure. Updates</strong> will be prepared according to the following timetable:</p>
        <center><table>
        	<tr>
        		<td>1st Quarter:</td>
        		<td>1 April - 15 May</td>
        	</tr>
        	<tr>
        		<td>2nd Quarter:</td>
        		<td>1 July - 15 August</td>
        	</tr>
        	<tr>
        		<td>3rd Quarter:</td>
        		<td>1 October - 15 November</td>
        	</tr>
        	<tr>
        		<td>4th Quarter / Yearly report:</td>
        		<td>15 January - 15 February</td>
        	</tr>
        </table></center>
        
        <p>The reports will be downloaded shortly afterwards and sent to the ODAnic Community in EXCEL format for the quarterly reports and as EXCEL, .pdf and as EU Blue Book documents for the yearly reports. All reports will be available as either aggregated or disaggregated for the European Commission and each EU Member State in the download section.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Responsibility</strong></p>
        <p>All EU donors have selected a focal point who is responsible for collecting, entering and updating the data online on a quarterly basis. Accuracy and completeness of the data is dependent on the individual EU donor inputting the data and can only be guaranteed up to the last quarterly disbursement; forecasts are based on estimates.</p>
