        <p>ODAmoz is a new EC funded electronic tool that provides information on Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Mozambique. It was created in response to the Paris Declaration advocating for strengthened coordination and harmonization among Donors and alignment with the Government of Mozambique. </p>
        <p>ODAmoz enables to track Donors&#39; and United Nations Agencies&#39; projects and programmes in the country: where they are operating, who finances them, and which organization implements them. </p>
        <p>It is a user-friendly database, accessible to all through the internet. Its &quot;Design your own report&quot; function makes it easy to search for specific information through a set of predefined criteria (donor, sector, location, project status, funding type and MDGs) and offers tables and geographic maps (ODAmap) for analysis. </p>
        <p>Welcome to ODAmoz!</p>
          
      introduction_long: |
        <p align="justify">
        <b>History</b><br>
        In 2005, the EC Delegation in Mozambique hired a consultant in the context of
        the EU Pilot Initiative on Coordination &amp; Harmonization in order to establish
        among other a common EU Project Database DbIS. This database was established,
        centralizing and making available the information on activities of all EU Member
        States operating in Mozambique.
        </p>
        <p>In a further step of overall Donor harmonization in Mozambique in the light
        of the Paris Declaration, it was agreed to open up the EU DbIS to <strong>ALL</strong>
        Donors present in Mozambique and merge with the UN Project Database to a new
        common Donor database called ODAmoz.</p>
        <p>This initiative was fully endorsed by the Development Partners Group in
        charge of the simplification and harmonization of development cooperation in the
        country. </p>
        <p>In light of the need to guarantee Government of Mozambique ownership and to
        ensure a proper administrative set up of the project, management of ODAmoz was
        handed over to the designated directorate in the Ministry of Planning and
        Development (MPD): the Direcao Nacional de Investimento e Cooperacao (DIC) in
        September 2006 and a <strong>ODAmoz Management Committee</strong> installed in
        late 2006, composed of Donor and GoM representatives.</p>
        <p align="justify">
        <b>Objective</b><br>
        The main objective and focus of ODAmoz is to provide donors with a tool, based
        on international standards (e.g. OECD/DAC sector codification), to fulfil their
        obligations towards the Government of Mozambique of reporting and planning on
        quarterly disbursements (see downloads). <br>
        It also gives the GOM, donors and the public in general a snapshot of donors and
        UN agencies projects and financial commitments.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Update timeline</strong><br>
        As mentioned above, ODAmoz focuses on reports on quarterly disbursement data and
        forecasts for the current year and annual values for further <strong>3 years
        according to Medium Term Expenditure Forecast (MTEF) procedure</strong><br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The ODAmoz Management Committee agreed to link the update procedure to the
        Official Budget Cycle of GoM. In general the <strong>update deadlines</strong>
        will be followed according to below mentioned dates:<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        1st Quarter:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        1st of April - 15th of May<br>
        2nd Quarter:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        1st of July - 15th of August<br>
        3rd Quarter:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        1st of October - 15th of November<br>
        4th Quarter / Yearly report:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        15th of January - 15th of February<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The reports will be downloaded shortly afterwards and sent to the ODAmoz
        Community in EXCEL format for the quarterly reports and as EXCEL and .pdf
        documents for the yearly reports. All reports will be available aggregated and
        disaggregated per Donor/UN Agency in the download section.</p>
        <p align="justify">
        <b>UN Reporting Specificity</b><br>
        Due to UN&#39;s specific and heterogenic funding arrangements (working with both
        core and donor funds) and the difficulty in separating them, <strong>it has now
        been agreed that UN agencies can fully report on their overall funding (core +
        donor) even if possibly already reported by a Donor in ODAmoz</strong>. The
        respective Donor implementing a project via an UN Agency will need to explicitly
        state this in the concerned Project Nr e.g.: An EC Project Nr: 9ACPMOZ011,
        implemented via UNDP should be inserted in <strong>ODAmoz</strong> as
        9ACPMOZ011/UNDP.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Donor Totals and UN Agency totals therefore should not be added up in order to
        avoid double counting. In the Search by Donor Report, Donors and UN Agencies
        already have been separated. It is planned to enable this for each query
        possibility. <br>
        Please note that this therefore does not always enable us to have a clear
        picture of the full combined Donor and UN ODA to Mozambique.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
        <b>Responsibility</b><br>
        Each Donor and UN agency has selected a focal point that is responsible for
        collecting, entering and updating the data online on a quarterly basis. Accuracy
        and completeness of the data can only be guaranteed up to the last quarterly
        disbursement; forecasts are based on estimates.
        </p>
        <p>The Ministry of Planning and Development (MPD) and its Directorate for
        Investment and Cooperation (DIC) is gradually taking up responsibility for the
        general overview of the database and production of the quarterly reports on
        Donor disbursements. </p>
        <p align="justify">
        <b>ODAmoz&#39; Vision</b><br>
        ODAmoz is becoming more and more Donor inclusive, and is seen as a very useful
        tool, e.g. in the On/Off-Budget discussions with the Government of Mozambique
        and in providing a common source of information for many of the Donors involved
        that are revising their country strategies.
        </p>
        <p>The intention is therefore, among other, to train focal points in each sector
        line ministry at central and provincial level as users in order for the
        Government of Mozambique to fully exploit ODAmoz&#39;s potential.</p>
